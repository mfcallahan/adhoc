			<h1>How to Get a GMRS License</h1>

		<p>
         General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a land-mobile UHF radio service in the United States, near 462 and 467 MHz. GMRS <a href="https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/FRS/GMRS_combined_channel_chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shares the same frequencies</a> with the Family Radio Service (FRS), however output power is limited to 0.5 or 2 watts on FRS, depending on the channel. A license is required to operate on the GMRS band, and the licensee is allowed up to 5 or 50 watts of output power (also depending on the channel). A GMRS license also grants permission to operate on the repeater input frequencies. Both the increased output power and the repeater access granted by a GMRS license can dramatically increase the effective range a GMRS radio has over a FRS radio. Because they share the same frequencies, GMRS radios are allowed to communicate with FRS radios via simplex.

         To obtain a GMRS license and call sign, you must file an application with the FCC and pay a $70 fee. No exam is required, and the license is valid for 10 years. The FCC's <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/systems-utilities/universal-licensing-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Universal Licensing System</a> (ULS) is is an online portal to manage your FCC applications/licenses, and pay any applicable fees via a single account. The ULS eliminates the need for paper applications and submitting via snail mail. You may also view the status of pending licenses in the ULS. Once registered with the ULS, you will receive an FCC Registration Number (FRN). This is a 10-digit number that is assigned to a business or individual registering with the FCC, and is used to identify the registrant's business dealings with the FCC. Save your FCC Identification Number - it will be your user name to log in to the Universal Licensing System.

         Before continuing, there is one very important consideration that should be noted when dealing with FCC licenses. Your call sign and license information is public information and is easily searchable in FCC databases and other 3rd party records. Should you choose to register with your home address, this will be visible to anybody searching the FCC database. Exposing personal information on the internet is a concern now more than ever, so one approach to limiting the amount of personal information in FCC databases is to use a P.O. Box as your contact address. Here is what Matt's GMRS license information looks like when queried in the FCC database  â€“ <a href="http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=3959322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WRAA720</a>:

         WRAA720 uses this P.O. Box address in the center of their local metro area as the primary contact location for all FCC forms and dealings. WRAA720's actual home address is not associated with any of their FCC licenses and will not be found in any FCC databases, or in other databases that use FCC data such as <a href="https://www.qrz.com/lookup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QRZ.com</a>.

		</p>
		<p>
			<h2 style="color:blue;">Step 4: Submit the application</h2>

		<p>
         When you submit the application, you will be prompted to complete payment. After that, all you can do is wait! Applications will appear in <a href="http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/ApplicationSearch/searchAppl.jsp">ULS Application Search</a> in about one or two businesses days after the application is filed. If you made an error in the application don't worry! You can file an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/amending-application-universal-licensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amendment to the application</a>. See the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/applying-new-license-universal-licensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applying for a New License in the Universal Licensing System FAQ</a> for more information about the application process for FCC licenses.

        <p><h1>How to Get a GMRS License</h1></p>
        <p>General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a land-mobile UHF radio service in the United States, near 462 and 467 MHz. GMRS&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/FRS/GMRS_combined_channel_chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shares the same frequencies</a>&nbsp;with the Family Radio Service (FRS), however output power is limited to 0.5 or 2 watts on FRS, depending on the channel. A license is required to operate on the GMRS band, and the licensee is allowed up to 5 or 50 watts of output power (also depending on the channel). A GMRS license also grants permission to operate on the repeater input frequencies. Both the increased output power and the repeater access granted by a GMRS license can dramatically increase the effective range a GMRS radio has over a FRS radio. Because they share the same frequencies, GMRS radios are allowed to communicate with FRS radios via simplex.</p>
        <p>To obtain a GMRS license and call sign, you must file an application with the FCC and pay a $70 fee. No exam is required, and the license is valid for 10 years. The FCC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/new-users-guide-getting-started-universal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Universal Licensing System</a>&nbsp;(ULS) is is an online portal to manage your FCC applications/licenses, and pay any applicable fees via a single account. The ULS eliminates the need for paper applications and submitting via snail mail. You may also view the status of pending licenses in the ULS. Once registered with the ULS, you will receive an FCC Registration Number (FRN). This is a 10-digit number that is assigned to a business or individual registering with the FCC, and is used to identify the registrant&rsquo;s business dealings with the FCC. Save this ID number! It will be your user name to log in to the Universal Licensing System.</p>
        <p>Before continuing, there is one very important consideration that should be noted when dealing with FCC licenses. Your call sign and license information is public information and is easily searchable in FCC databases and other 3rd party records. Should you choose to register with your home address, this will be visible to anybody if they have your call sign. Exposing personal information on the internet is a concern now more than ever, so one approach to limiting the amount of personal information in FCC databases is to use a P.O. Box as your contact address. Here is what Matt's GMRS license information looks like when queried in the FCC database &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=3959322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WRAA720</a>:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yNVWELZ.png"></p>
        <p>WRAA720 uses this P.O. Box address in the center of their local metro area as the  primary contact location for all FCC forms and dealings. WRAA720's actual home address is not associated with any of their FCC licenses and will not be found in any FCC databases, or in other databases that use FCC data such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.qrz.com/lookup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QRZ.com</a>.</p>
      <p><h2 style="color:blue;">Step 1: Create an FCC Universal Licensing System account</h2></p>
        <p>If you are a first time user,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/coresWeb/publicHome.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a new ULS account here</a>&nbsp;(skip this step if you have an existing ULS account). Select &ldquo;Register&rdquo; to be issued a new FCC Registration Number:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FZu6K00.png" /></p>
        <p>Some questions are asked before proceeding, then you can fill out an application with your name, address, password, etc:</p>

      <p><h2 style="color:blue;">Step 2: Log in to the ULS</h2></p>
        <p>After creating the account, or if you have an existing ULS account,&nbsp;<a href="https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsEntry/licManager/login.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">log in here</a>.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IUaBYNz.png" /></p>
        <p>Once you are logged in, you will be taken to this screen which shows your current and applied for licenses:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/p9W5ECg.png" /></p>
      <p><h2 style="color:blue;">Step 3: Begin application for a GMRS license</h2></p>
        <p>Now you can apply for a GMRS license and pay the fee. On the left hand side menu click &ldquo;Apply for a New License.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XqYxsc4.png" /></p>
        <p>On the next screen, select &ldquo;ZA-General Mobile Radio Service&rdquo; from the very bottom of the drop down menu and click Continue.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FcIaXfF.png" />The next step is to answer these applicant questions. Most people can leave &ldquo;no&rdquo; selected for each:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/T4Nlin9.png" />Click continue after these questions, and on the next screen supply the licensee name and address:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3At1mp6.png" /></p>
        <p>Once this is complete, click Continue. The next step is to answer the following question, then click Continue again:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/43cKWFb.png" /></p>

        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FLitZrZ.png" /></p>
      <p><h2 style="color:blue;">Step 4: Submit the application</h2></p>
        <p>The final step before submitting application is reading all the certification statements, which summarize the rules you are agreeing to follow as a GMRS license holder. Electronically sign the application and submit:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nc6RYVv.png" /></p>
        <p>When you submit the application, you will be prompted to complete payment. After that, all you can do is wait! Applications will appear in&nbsp;<a href="http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/ApplicationSearch/searchAppl.jsp">ULS Application Search</a>&nbsp;in about one or two businesses days after the application is filed. If you made an error in the application &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry! You can file an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/amending-application-universal-licensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amendment to the application</a>. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/applying-new-license-universal-licensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applying for a New License in the Universal Licensing System FAQ</a>&nbsp;for more information about the application process for FCC licenses.</p>
      <p><h2 style="color:blue;">Step 5: Receive call sign and download authorization documents</h2></p>
        <p>Check back to the Universal Licensing System daily, and when you see the call sign under &ldquo;My Licenses&rdquo; you are ready to get on the air! To download or print a paper copy of the license authorization, click Download Electronic Authorizations:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nL0RisA.png" /></p>
        <p>Select your GMRS call sign from the &ldquo;Filter by Radio Service&rdquo; box and add it to the &ldquo;Authorizations to Download&rdquo; box then click Download:</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vsnaKHz.png" /></p>
        <p>The GMRS Authorization looks like this:</p>
